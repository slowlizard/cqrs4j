=Introduction=
Spring Integration is a framework (by Spring) that allows easy implementation of a pipes-and-filters architecture, making integration with other components and applications (via JMS, filesystem, email, etc) a lot easier.

=Configuring Spring integration support=
_cqrs4j_ provides out-of-the-box support for Spring Integration, allowing you to easily publish events on a Spring Integration channel.

All you need to do is make sure all necessary Spring Integration libraries are on your classpath and configure a `SpringIntegrationEventBus` in your application context.

The `SpringIntegrationEventBus` needs to be configured with a `SubscribableChannel` to which it can forward events and register listeners to. All events are automatically wrapped into a `GenericMessage` with the event as payload.

Note: _cqrs4j_ only requires the Spring Integration Core library.
