= Getting started =

== Configuring maven ==

Add the following code in your dependencies section:
{{{
<dependency>
  <groupId>nl.gridshore.cqrs4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>cqrs4j</artifactId>
  <version>0.1</version>
</dependency>
}}}

Make sure your maven installation has access to the cqrs4j repository, where the necessary jars and poms are located. 

If you use a repository proxy, such as Artifactory, configure the following url:
`http://cqrs4j.googlecode.com/svn/repo`

You can also add a repository configuration to you pom.xml:

{{{
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>cqrs4j</id>
    <url>http://cqrs4j.googlecode.com/svn/repo</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
}}}

== Additional dependencies ==

Most of the features provided by the _cqrs4j_ framework are optional and require additional dependencies. We have chosen not to add these dependencies by default, as they would possibly clutter your project with stuff you don't need.

Below is a table of additional features and the extra dependencies you need:

|| *Feature* || *Dependency* ||
|| [EventSourcing Event sourcing] || com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream:1.3.1 ||
|| Transaction aware event handler adapters || org.springframework:spring-tx:3.0.0.RELEASE ||
|| Spring Integration support || org.springframework.integration:spring-integration-core:1.0.3.RELEASE |||

Note: the version numbers are the ones _cqrs4j_ has been tested with. Other versions might work, but might not.
